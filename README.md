# Ubuntu Lomiri Remix
Ubuntu Lomiri is an Ubuntu Remix with the Lomiri desktop and attempted X11/Wayland compatibility.
If you would like to become a bug reporter, than be prepared to submit how to reproduce the issue, what caused it and etc.
We only have a couple of wallpapers besides the default Lomiri wallpapers.
Enjoy this remix!
